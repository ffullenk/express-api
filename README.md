express-api
===========

A Restful api using node-js, express and mongoose

Goals for the Web service:

-Simple API design and pragmatic REST Web service, with only 2 base URLs per resource
-Keep verbs out of your base URLs
-Our HTTP verbs are POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-Concrete names are better than abstract
